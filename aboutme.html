<strong>C</strong> is my backbone programming language and I love <strong>Python</strong>. I am competent in rapid <strong>hardware prototyping</strong> including <strong>PCB design</strong> and electronic circuit debugging.

I enjoy solving firmware problems that have performance constraints, limited memory resources, or tight timing. 

I write code for developers. Sensibly organized projects. Well-structured code. Google-style guide. Unit Testing. Consistency.
