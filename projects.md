## IoT

- **[IoT with Microsoft Azure](/_posts/2016-05-21-microsoft-azure.md)** - when Microsoft Azure was at its infant level I built an end-to-end solution.



## Packages
- **[Time Server](/_posts/2020-04-30-Time-Server.md)** - for Arduino Uno.
- **[ST-Link Utility Automation](/_posts/2018-12-10-stlink-utility.md)** - to automate flashing STM32 MCUs.



## Development Boards

- **[TechShopBD](/_posts/2013-04-19-Electronic-Modules-for-Techshopbd.md)** - developed numerous development boards when I was working for TechShopBD.
- **[LoRaWAN Shield](/_posts/2018-03-11-LoRaWAN-Shield.md)** - a LoRaWAN extension board, using Haxiot LoRaWAN module, for any Arduino form factor board and STM32 Nucleo board.



## Robotics
During my time at Next Gen System I worked on robotics. As at the same time I was pursuing my MSc, I took several robotics courses too. Here are a list of all robotics related work:

- **[Zeno, A Social Robot](/_posts/2014-08-15-Zeno-A-Social-Robot.md)** -  used for early detection of Autism in children.
- **[Sensorize KUKA youBot](/_posts/2015-04-30-Sensorize-KUKA-youBot.md)** - a simple sensor based HMI framework that allows teleoperation along with basic levels of autonomous.
- **[Kalman Filter for Moving Object Tracking](/_posts/2015-12-12-Kalman-Filter.md)** - to  track,  estimate and predict position of an object.
- **[Human Robot Interaction with Robotic Skin](/_posts/2016-03-05-HRI.md)** - high resolution skin for robots.
- **[Potential Field for Mobile Robots](/_posts/2016-04-24-Potential-Field.md)** - for autonomous bots.
- **[Face Tracking with OpenCV](/_posts/2016-08-02-face-tracking.md)** - with a moving camera to track continuously.
- **[Computational Motion Planning](/_posts/2016-09-15-Computational-Motion-Planning.md)** - for autonomous bots.

## Misc
- **[Graduation Cap](/_posts/2016-05-13-Graduation-Cap.md)** - for my MSc convocation.
- **[PCB Art](/_posts/2020-01-18-pcb-art.md)** - how to make PCB badge.
- **[Audio Visualizer](/_posts/2020-02-02-audio-visualizer.md)** - using RGB LED.


## Games
- **[Minesweeper](/files/Minesweeper)** - tiny Minesweeper game.  It's not fancy at all, but it was fun exercise.
- **[Lightsout](/files/lightsout)** - An implementation of the puzzle game Lights Out using Python. Available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mirzafahad/lightsout).
