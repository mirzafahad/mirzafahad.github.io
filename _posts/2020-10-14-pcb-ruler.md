Every time I design a PCB I always get confused about the actual size of the components and I end up printing the footprint on a paper to see what the actual size looks like. Well, I now made this ruler with some of the common components I use from time to time. No more destroying(!) trees. With black matte soldermask and enig finishing this turned out really great.

N.B. This design is a modified version of Lady Ada's ruler design.
