Everytime I design a PCB I always get confused about the actual size and I end up with printing the footprint on a paper to see what the actual size look like. Well, I now made this ruler with some of the common components I use time to time. No more destroying(!) tree.

N.B. This design is a modified version of the Lady Ada's ruler design.
