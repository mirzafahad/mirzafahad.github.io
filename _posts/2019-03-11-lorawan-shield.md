Haxiot developed the LoRaWAN® expansion board for STM32 Nucleo and Arduino development boards. This board is an integrated solution that provides an affordable and flexible way for users to learn and develop solutions using LoRa® technology.

The HXC Expansion Board features the Haxiot® LoRaWAN™ technology module, addressing low-cost and low-power wide area network (LPWAN), which comes with the embedded AT-command stack pre-loaded.

The HXC Expansion Board can be controlled from an external host such as NUCLEO-L053R8 or Arduino Uno boards, running the HXC-Client-Embedded-API software. This software provides the means to set up a complete LoRaWAN™ node.

The LoRaWAN™ stack is certified class A and C compliant.

The HXC Expansion Board includes the Haxiot® LoRaWAN™ module, Arduino™ connectors, slide switch, RGB LED, a U.FL connector, an antenna, and one Microchip temperature sensor. The HXC Client library and example code is available for STM32 Nucleo-L053R8 using Mbed and can be tailored to any other platform.
