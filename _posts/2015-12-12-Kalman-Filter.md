subtitle: For Moving Object Tracking!

As a part of Intelligent System course project, I implemented kalman filter to track a line following robot. I used Matlab's image toolbox for image processing to measure the position of a robot from a video.

Project report can be found [here](/files/KalmanFilter.pdf).
