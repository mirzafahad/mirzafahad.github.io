['Code Kata'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) is a programming exercise for programmers to hone their skills. The name, Kata, came from the Japanese concept of Kata in the martial Arts.

There are [21 different katas](http://codekata.com/) that you can practice. I was asked by an interviewer to solve [Roman Calculator Kata](http://bit.ly/1VfHqlj). Particularly, just the addition and the subtraction. This might sound easy if you are considering that you will convert the Roman numbers into integers, add/sub them and convert back. But the problem is if you are a Roman, you don't even know what is an integer. So the calculator that you are going to implement, must do the addition/subtraction the way the Romans did.

The procedures that Romans followed are explained in detail [here](http://turner.faculty.swau.edu/mathematics/materialslibrary/roman/) and [here](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/08/16/roman-numerals-and-arithmetic/). My solution can be found (here](http://github.com/mirzafahad/codeKata_RomanCalculator), written in C.

Although it wasn't allowed to turn the roman number into integer, but I will have a function to do exactly that so that I can cross validate my result. This way I can convert any roman numbers to decimal or vice versa to test my actual Roman Calculator code. It seems converting roman numbers is a '[Project Euler Problems](http://projecteuler.net/)' ([Problem 89](http://projecteuler.net/problem=89)). The math behind the conversion is explained [here](http://www.mathsisfun.com/roman-numerals.html).


##Roman Converter:

###Roman-to-Decimal:
My Roman Converter lib has two global functions, **roman2dec()** and **dec2roman()**. Roman to decimal converter was divided into two functions, **roman2dec\_char()** and  **roman2dec\_str()**. 
**roman2dec\_char** will take a single character and will return corresponding decimal value.


Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
