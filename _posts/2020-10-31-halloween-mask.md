Made a Halloween Mask decoration for my kid, using a couple of TFT displays and an LDR. She is really excited and horrified at the same time :D

Checkout [this youtube link](https://youtu.be/H35RDPNnSZM) if you want to see how I made the mask.

PCB files and code are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mirzafahad/halloween_mask).
