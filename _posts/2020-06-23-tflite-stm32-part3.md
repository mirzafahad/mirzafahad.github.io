# STM32Cube IDE
I already mentioned earlier that I am going to use [**32F746GDISCOVERY**](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html) development board that has an LCD. And I will be using [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) to code.
Download the software if you don't already have it and install.
