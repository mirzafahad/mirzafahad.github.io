In robotics, we sometimes need to ask robots to go from one place to another. How the robot will move in an 
unstructured environment is decide by something called motion planning. There are several motion planning algorithm
that we can use.

I explored two algorithms, Dijkstra and A* (pronounced A-star). The simulation was created using Matlab:

In this next simulation we will create a configuration space for a two-link robot arm. The arm will move from a starting point to a destination in that configuration space, finding its way using Dijkstra algorithm. Here is the MATLAB simulation:
