A device that collects GPS coordinates and send it to a server through LTE. Made specifically for vehicle including an OBD interface. The server shows the vehicle position on GOOGLE map. Designed the schematic and the PCB layout, and wrote low-level device drivers for it.

There is a [Project Report](/files/vehicle_tracking_system.pdf) based on it.
