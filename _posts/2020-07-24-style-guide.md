My coding style changes everytime I change my employer. Every company has their own flavor of coding style. When it comes to my personal project I tend to follow the style that I am following at work. So, different projects of mine followed different coding styles depends on when I did it. 

To be consistent across my personal projects, I am writing this style guide, for __myself__, collected from different standards (Google, MISRA, etc.) according to my likings.

Doesn't matter what you follow, be consistent.

You can find the guide [on GitHub](https://github.com/mirzafahad/embedded_c_style_guide).
